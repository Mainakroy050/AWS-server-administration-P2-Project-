# AWS-server-administration-P2-Project-
Implementing and maintaining a routing and switching network in AWS using CentOS server administration for a centralized large network

1. Project Overview
•	Objective: Define the purpose of your routing and switching network (e.g., connecting various services, managing traffic, VPN access).

•	Network Size: Assess the number of users, servers, and data flow to plan resources accordingly.
2. Architecture Design
•	Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Create a VPC to provide isolated networking.
•	Subnets: Divide your VPC into public and private subnets for better security and resource management.
3. Core AWS Services
•	Amazon VPC: Set up your VPC with multiple subnets:

o	Public Subnets: For load balancers, NAT gateways, and other services that require direct internet access.
o	Private Subnets: For application servers and databases that should not be directly accessible from the internet.

•	Elastic IPs: Use Elastic IPs for static public IP addresses where needed.

•	Route Tables: Configure route tables to manage traffic flow between subnets and to/from the internet.


4. Routing and Switching Configuration
•	AWS Transit Gateway: Consider using a Transit Gateway for centralizing and simplifying the connection between multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.

•	VPN Gateway: Set up a VPN Gateway if you need to connect your AWS network to an on-premises network securely.

•	Route Tables:
o	Configure route tables to direct traffic between subnets and the internet.
o	Use NAT gateways in public subnets to allow private subnet instances to access the internet.
5. CentOS Server Configuration
•	EC2 Instances: Deploy CentOS instances in your private subnets for network administration tasks.

•	Network Configuration:

o	Use ifconfig or ip commands to configure network interfaces.
o	Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ to manage network configurations persistently.

•	Firewall Configuration: Configure firewalls (e.g., firewalld or iptables) to control inbound and outbound traffic.

•	Routing Configuration:
o	Use routing commands (route, ip route) to manage static routes as necessary.
o	Configure dynamic routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF) if required for more complex networks.
6. Monitoring and Maintenance
•	AWS CloudWatch: Monitor network traffic and instance performance.
•	AWS Systems Manager: Manage your CentOS servers centrally, allowing for updates, patch management, and automation
.
•	Logging: Use CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs to track API calls and network traffic for security and compliance.
7. Security Best Practices
•	IAM Policies: Implement least privilege access using IAM roles and policies for users and applications.
•	Security Groups and NACLs: Set up Security Groups and Network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance and subnet level.
•	Encryption: Ensure data in transit is encrypted using TLS and consider encrypting data at rest.
8. Backup and Recovery
•	Automated Snapshots: Set up automated snapshots of your EC2 instances and RDS databases for data recovery.
•	Cross-Region Backups: Consider replicating critical data across regions for disaster recovery.
9. Cost Management
•	AWS Budgets: Set budgets and monitor your spending to avoid unexpected costs.
•	Cost Explorer: Analyze resource usage to optimize costs effectively.
10. Testing and Validation
•	Network Testing: Use tools like ping, traceroute, and iperf to test connectivity and bandwidth between instances and services.
•	Staging Environment: Maintain a staging environment to test network changes before implementing them in production.
11. Documentation and Maintenance
•	Documentation: Keep comprehensive documentation of your network architecture, configurations, and operational procedures.
•	Change Management: Use version control for configuration changes and maintain a log of all changes for accountability.
Conclusion
Implementing and maintaining a routing and switching network in AWS using CentOS involves a combination of AWS networking services and traditional server administration practices. This provides a framework to establish a scalable and secure network architecture
